The latest version: :doc:`user_guide`.

This user guide will help you get started with ESP8684-DevKitM-1 and will also provide more in-depth information.


The ESP8684-DevKitM-1 is an entry-level development board based on ESP8684-MINI-1, a general-purpose module with 1 MB/2 MB/4 MB SPI flash. This board integrates complete Wi-Fi and Bluetooth LE functions.

Most of the I/O pins on the module are broken out to the pin headers on both sides of this board for easy interfacing. Developers can either connect peripherals with jumper wires or mount ESP8684-DevKitM-1 on a breadboard.

Start Application Development
-----------------------------

Before powering up your board, please make sure that it is in good condition with no obvious signs of damage.


Required Hardware
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- ESP8684-DevKitM-1
- USB 2.0 cable (Standard-A to Micro-B)
- Computer running Windows, Linux, or macOS

.. note::

  Be sure to use an appropriate USB cable. Some cables are for charging only and do not provide the needed data lines nor work for programming the boards.


Software Setup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Please proceed to `Get Started <https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/get-started/index.html>`__, where Section `Installation Step by Step <https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/get-started/index.html#get-started-step-by-step>`__ will quickly help you set up the development environment then flash an application example onto your board.


ESP-AT Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ESP8684-DevKitM-1 supports ESP-AT software that provides a set of AT commands with which you can quickly integrate wireless connectivity features into your product without a need for embedded application development of the module on this development board.

The software is available as a pre-built binary that can be downloaded from `ESP-AT repository <https://github.com/espressif/esp-at/tags>`_.

For more information about using ESP-AT, including information on how to customize pre-built binaries, please refer to `ESP-AT User Guide <https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-at/en/latest/>`_.

.. [1] P: Power supply; I: Input; O: Output; T: High impedance.
.. [2] GPIO8 and GPIO9 are strapping pins of the ESP8684 chip. These pins are used to control several chip functions depending on binary voltage values applied to the pins during chip power-up or system reset.


.. For description and application of the strapping pins, please refer to Section Strapping Pins in `ESP38684 Datasheet`_.
.. For the description of function names, please refer to `ESP8684 Chip Datasheet <insert your link here>`_ (PDF).
