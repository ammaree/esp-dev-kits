=======================

:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`

The older version: :doc:`user_guide_v1.1`

This user guide will help you get started with ESP32-C6-DevKitC-1 and will also provide more in-depth information.

ESP32-C6-DevKitC-1 is an entry-level development board based on `ESP32-C6-WROOM-1(U) <https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/documentation/esp32-c6-wroom-1_wroom-1u_datasheet_en.pdf>`_, a general-purpose module with a 8 MB SPI flash. This board integrates complete Wi-Fi, Bluetooth LE, Zigbee, and Thread functions.

Most of the I/O pins are broken out to the pin headers on both sides for easy interfacing. Developers can either connect peripherals with jumper wires or mount ESP32-C6-DevKitC-1 on a breadboard.

Start Application Development
-----------------------------

Before powering up your ESP32-C6-DevKitC-1, please make sure that it is in good condition with no obvious signs of damage.

Required Hardware
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- ESP32-C6-DevKitC-1
- USB-A to USB-C cable
- Computer running Windows, Linux, or macOS

.. note::

  Be sure to use a good quality USB cable. Some cables are for charging only and do not provide the needed data lines nor work for programming the boards.

Software Setup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Please proceed to `ESP-IDF Get Started <https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32c6/get-started/index.html>`__, which will quickly help you set up the development environment then flash an application example onto your board.

.. ESP-AT Support
.. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. The ESP32-C6-DevKitC-1 supports ESP-AT software that provides a set of AT commands with which you can quickly integrate wireless connectivity features into your product without a need for embedded application development of the module on this development board.

.. The software is available as a pre-built binary that can be downloaded from `ESP-AT repository <https://github.com/espressif/esp-at/tags>`_.

.. For more information about using ESP-AT, including information on how to customize pre-built binaries, please refer to `ESP-AT User Guide <https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-at/en/latest/>`_.

Power Supply Options
--------------------

There are three mutually exclusive ways to provide power to the board:

- USB Type-C to UART Port and ESP32-C6 USB Type-C Port (either one or both), default power supply (recommended)
- 5V and GND pin headers
- 3V3 and GND pin headers

.. _user-guide-c6-devkitc-1-v1.2-current:

Current Measurement
-------------------

The J5 headers on ESP32-C6-DevKitC-1 (see J5 in Figure :ref:`user-guide-c6-devkitc-1-v1.2-board-front`) can be used for measuring the current drawn by the ESP32-C6-WROOM-1(U) module:

- Remove the jumper: Power supply between the module and peripherals on the board is cut off. To measure the module's current, connect the board with an ammeter via J5 headers.
- Apply the jumper (factory default): Restore the board's normal functionality.

.. note::

  When using 3V3 and GND pin headers to power the board, please remove the J5 jumper, and connect an ammeter in series to the external circuit to measure the module's current.

Header Block 
------------- 

The two tables below provide the **Name** and **Function** of the pin headers on both sides of the board (J1 and J3). The pin header names are shown in Figure :ref:`user-guide-c6-devkitc-1-v1.2-board-front`. The numbering is the same as in the `ESP32-C6-DevKitC-1 Schematic v1.2`_ (PDF).
