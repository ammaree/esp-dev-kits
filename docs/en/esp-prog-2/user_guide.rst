This user guide helps you get started with ESP-Prog-2, and provides a detailed introduction to its features and capabilities.

ESP-Prog-2 is a development and debugging tool released by Espressif. It supports function such as automatic firmware downloading, serial communication, and JTAG online debugging. Automatic downloading and serial communication are compatible with ESP8266, ESP32, ESP32-S2, ESP32-S3, and ESP32-C3, while JTAG online debugging is supported on ESP32, ESP32-S2, ESP32-S3, and ESP32-C3.

ESP-Prog-2 is simple in design and easy to use—only one USB cable is needed to connect it to a computer. The computer automatically recognizes two ports, one for downloading and the other for JTAG debugging, based on the port numbers.

Considering that different target boards may operate at different voltages, both ESP-Prog-2 interfaces support either 5 V or 3.3 V power supply voltage. The voltage can be selected via jumper pins, providing compatibility with a variety of boards. However, while the power supply can switch between 3.3 V and 5 V, the RX/TX and JTAG signal levels are fixed at 3.3 V.

The key components of the board are described in clockwise order.

.. list-table:: Key Components on ESP-Prog-2
   :widths: 25 75
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Key Component
     - Description
   * - ESP32-S3-MINI-1
     - The ESP32-S3-MINI-1 is a versatile Wi-Fi and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) MCU module. It features a variety of peripheral interfaces and comes with a PCB-mounted antenna. The core of the module is the ESP32-S3 chip.
   * - Reset Button
     - Used to restart the target system being debugged.
   * - Boot Button
     - Target system download button. Press and hold the **Boot** button, then briefly press the **Reset** button to enter the Firmware Download mode, allowing you to download the firmware to the target system via the serial port for debugging. It can be used as a confirmation button during normal operation.
   * - Boot On/Off
     - Header pin used to configure the status of the IO0 Strapping pin.
   * - PROG PWR SEL
     - Header pin used to select the program interface power supply input voltage (3.3 V or 5 V).
   * - PROG 2.54 mm
     - Program interface with 2.54 mm (0.1") pin spacing.
   * - PROG 1.27 mm
     - Program interface with 1.27 mm (0.05") pin spacing.
   * - USB Type-C Port
     - The USB Type-C interface on the ESP32-S3 chip supports USB 2.0 Full-Speed mode, with a data transfer rate of up to 12 Mbps (Note that the interface does not support 480 Mbps high-speed transfer mode). This interface can be used as a power supply interface for the board, and supports communication with ESP32-S3 via USB protocol.
   * - JTAG 1.27 mm
     - JTAG interface with 1.27 mm (0.05") pin spacing.
   * - JTAG 2.54 mm
     - JTAG interface with 2.54 mm (0.1") pin spacing.
   * - JTAG PWR SEL
     - Header pin used to select the JTAG interface power input voltage (3.3 V or 5 V).
   * - LED indicator
     - Displays the status of ESP-Prog-2. There are three LED modes: red, green, and blue.  The red LED is on when the system’s 3.3 V power is active; the green LED is on when the automatic firmware downloading and serial communication functions are in use; the blue LED is on when the JTAG online debugging function is active.
   * - ESP32-S3 Boot Button
     - The ESP32-S3 download button for ESP32-S3 firmware downloading. To enter firmware download mode, power on the ESP-Prog-2 again while pressing the ESP32-S3 Boot button.
   * - Extension Connector
     - Extension IO connector used to bring out the idle IOs of ESP32-S3. You can customize pins to extend the additional functionality of ESP-Prog-2.


Start Application Development
-----------------------------

Before powering on, ensure the board is in good condition.

Required Hardware
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- ESP-Prog-2
- USB-A to USB-C conversion cable
- A computer (Windows, Linux, or macOS)
- Dupont wires or the ribbon cable provided by Espressif to connect the development board and ESP-Prog-2

.. note::

    Be sure to use an appropriate USB cable. Some cables can only be used for charging, and cannot be used for data transmission or programming.


Hardware Setup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Connect the ESP-Prog-2 board to the PC USB port using a USB cable.
2. Use the PROG PWR SEL or JTAG PWR SEL header pin to select the power supply output voltage for the Program interface or JTAG interface.
3. Use the ribbon cable provided by Espressif to connect the ESP-Prog-2 debugging board to the Espressif target board.
4. Use the Espressif official software tools or scripts to enable automatic downloading and JTAG debugging functions.

Software Setup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
