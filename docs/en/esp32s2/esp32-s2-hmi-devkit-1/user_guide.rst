Start Application Development
-----------------------------

Before powering up your board, please make sure that it is in good condition with no obvious signs of damage.


Required Hardware
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  1 x PC loaded with Windows, macOS or Linux (Linux operating system is recommended)
-  1 x ESP32-S2-HMI-DevKit-1
-  1 x USB-C cable (it is recommended to prepare two USB-C cables if you want to evaluate MCU’s USB functions)
-  1 x Speaker (8 Ohm, 2 W)
-  1 x microSD card (some examples may have large storage needs)

.. note::

  Be sure to use an appropriate USB cable. Some cables are for charging only and do not provide the needed data lines nor work for programming the boards.


Hardware Setup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To facilitate your quick evaluation of all examples, please follow these steps to set up the board:

1. Insert microSD card into the connector. Please make sure all the important data is backed up, as the microSD card may be formatted if its partition format is not FAT.
2. If you need to evaluate the audio playback function, please connect the speaker pad near the USB port on the bottom of the board to the supplied speaker, or to another speaker with a similar size (8 Ohm, 2 W).


Software Setup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

First, please make sure you have configured the ESP-IDF development environment correctly. To ensure this, please enter ``idf.py --version`` in your terminal and if the output is similar to ``ESP-IDF v4.2-dev-2084-g98d5b5dfd``, it means you have installed ESP-IDF correctly. For detailed information about installation and configuration, please refer to `ESP-IDF Get Started <https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32s2/get-started/index.html>`__.

After configuration completed, you can switch back to the ``esp-dev-kits/esp32-s2-hmi-devkit-1`` directory. All code examples are placed under the examples directory, you can build projects by running ``idf.py build``.

-  ``(Top) > HMI Board Config > Audio HAL``: Select audio output interface, whether to use PWM or DAC;
-  ``(Top) > HMI Board Config > LCD Drivers``: Select display IC type for LCD. By default, ESP32-S2-HMI-DevKit-1 uses RM68120 as its display IC;
-  In ``(Top) > Component config > ESP32S2-specific``, please go to the ``Support for external, SPI-connected RAM`` option:

   -  Go to ``SPI RAM config > Set RAM clock speed``, and set the PSRAM clock as ``80 MHz clock speed``;

-  ``(Top) -> Component config -> FreeRTOS``: set ``Tick rate (Hz)`` as 1000.

In each example folder, we have provided a default configuration file named ``sdkconfig.defaults``, with above options configured correctly.


ESP-IDF Version Dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``examples/esp32-s2-hmi-devkit-1/examples/storage/usb_msc`` example needs to be built in IDF v4.3, while other examples can be built in IDF v4.2 and later versions.

**Notice:** Due to strict regulation on battery export, for deliveries outside of China mainland, we are shipping ESP32-S2-HMI-DevKit-1 without the battery. As a substitute, you can use the iPhone 5 replacement battery (the connector type is non-standard). The battery capacity is not critical.

Power Supply Options
------------------------

The power of the ESP32-S2-HMI-DevKit-1 development board is divided into a 5 V power domain and a 3.3 V power domain, so as to reduce power consumption, improve power efficiency and support battery charging, part of which can be controlled by software whereas the other part is fixed in the hardware design.

To reduce current consumption, the preloaded firmware will power off all controlled power domains and put all ICs in low-power mode.

For more information, please refer to :ref:`power`.
