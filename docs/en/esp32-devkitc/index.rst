ESP32-DevKitC
=============

:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`

ESP32-DevKitC is a small-sized ESP32-based development board produced by `Espressif <https://espressif.com>`_. Most of the I/O pins are broken out to the pin headers on both sides for easy interfacing. Developers can either connect peripherals with jumper wires or mount ESP32-DevKitC on a breadboard.
