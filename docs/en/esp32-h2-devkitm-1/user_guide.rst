:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`

This user guide will help you get started with ESP32-H2-DevKitM-1 and will also provide more in-depth information.

ESP32-H2-DevKitM-1 is an entry-level development board based on Bluetooth® Low Energy and IEEE 802.15.4 combo module ESP32-H2-MINI-1 or ESP32-H2-MINI-1U.

Most of the I/O pins on the ESP32-H2-MINI-1/1U module are broken out to the pin headers on both sides of this board for easy interfacing. Developers can either connect peripherals with jumper wires or mount ESP32-H2-DevKitM-1 on a breadboard.

Power Supply Options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are three mutually exclusive ways to provide power to the board:

- USB Type-C to UART port, default power supply
- 5V and GND pin headers
- 3V3 and GND pin headers

.. _user-guide-h2-devkitm-1-current:

Current Measurement
-------------------

The J5 headers on ESP32-H2-DevKitM-1 (see J5 in Figure :ref:`user-guide-H2-devkitm-1-board-front`) can be used for measuring the current drawn by the ESP32-H2-MINI-1/1U module:

- Remove the jumper: Power supply between the module and peripherals on the board is cut off. To measure the module's current, connect the board with an ammeter via J5 headers.
- Apply the jumper (factory default): Restore the board's normal functionality.

.. note::

  When using 3V3 and GND pin headers to power the board, please remove the J5 jumper, and connect an ammeter in series to the external circuit to measure the module's current.

Header Block
------------

The two tables below provide the **Name** and **Function** of the pin headers on both sides of the board (J1 and J3). The pin header names are shown in `Pin Layout`_. The numbering is the same as in the ESP32-H2-DevKitM-1 Schematic. (see attached PDF).

Hardware Revision Details
=========================

- For boards with the PW number of and after PW-2024-02-0362 (on and after February 2024), the 32.768 kHz crystal is populated by default, while the series resistor connected here to the surrounding pins is updated to not populated. To optimize the circuit, the series resistor R7 on the UART_RXD has been updated to 470 Ω.

.. note::

  The PW number can be found in the product label on the large cardboard boxes for wholesale orders.
