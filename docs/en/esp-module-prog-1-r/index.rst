ESP-Module-Prog-1(R)
====================

:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`

ESP-Module-Prog-1 and ESP-Module-Prog-1R (R stands for WROVER) are two flashing mainboards produced by Espressif. They can be used to flash modules without soldering the module to the power supply and signal lines. The only difference between ESP-Module-Prog-1 and ESP-Module-Prog-1R lies in the layout of the spring pins, which are used to fit different modules.

ESP-Module-Prog-1 supports specific modules for ESP32, ESP32-S2, ESP32-S3, ESP32-C6, while ESP-Module-Prog-1R supports ESP32-WROVER modules. For details about the fitting modules for corresponding mainboard supports, please refer to the :ref:`fitting module list <fitting-modules-of-prog-1>`.
