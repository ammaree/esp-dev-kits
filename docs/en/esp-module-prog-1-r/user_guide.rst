====================

:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`

This user guide will help you get started with ESP-Module-Prog-1(R) and will also provide more in-depth information.

ESP-Module-Prog-1 and ESP-Module-Prog-1R (R stands for WROVER) are two flashing mainboards produced by Espressif. They can be used to flash modules without soldering the module to the power supply and signal lines. The mainboard can be used independently or in combination with a subboard. Espressif supports two subboards: ESP-Module-Prog-SUB-02 and ESP-Module-Prog-SUB-01&04, which cannot be used independently and must be used in conjunction with any of the above-mentioned mainboards.

This user guide will introduce **ESP-Module-Prog-1(R) Mainboard**. For detailed information about the subboards, please click the links below and check the corresponding user guides.

Board Overview
==============

ESP-Module-Prog-1(R) is an Espressif flashing mainboard designed specifically for modules. With a module mounted, it can also be used as a mini development board like ESP32-DevKitC. The only difference between ESP-Module-Prog-1 and ESP-Module-Prog-1R lies in the layout of the spring pins, which are used to fit different modules.

Start Application Development
=============================

Before powering up your ESP-Module-Prog-1(R), please make sure that it is in good condition with no obvious signs of damage.

Required Hardware
-----------------

- Any one of the above-mentioned Espressif modules
- USB-A to USB-C cable
- PC (Windows, Linux, or macOS)

.. note::

  Please make sure to use the appropriate USB cable. Some cables can only be used for charging, not for data transfer or program flashing.

Hardware Setup
--------------

Mount the module to ESP-Module-Prog-1(R) as follows:

1. Place the module lightly on ESP-Module-Prog-1(R), making sure the castellated holes on the module are aligned with the spring pins on the board.
2. Press the module inward until you hear a "click", which indicates that the module has been successfully mounted.
3. Check if all the spring pins are clicked into the castellated holes. If there is a misalignment, you can use tweezers to poke the spring pins into the castellated holes.

Now the board is ready for software setup.


Software Setup
--------------

Recommended Approach
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is recommended to use the ESP-IDF development framework to flash the binary file (\*.bin) to ESP-Module-Prog-1(R). Please refer to `ESP-IDF Get Started <https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/get-started/index.html>`__ to get a quick overview of setting up your development environment and flashing applications.

Alternative Approach
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For Windows systems, you can also use the `Flash Download Tool <https://www.espressif.com/en/support/download/other-tools?keys=FLASH+>`_ to flash the binary files.

.. note::

  1. To flash binary files, the chip should be set to Firmware Download mode. This can be done either by the flash tool automatically, or by holding down the Boot button and tapping the Reset button.
  2. After flashing binary files, the Flash Download Tool restarts your module and boots the flashed application by default.


Hardware Reference
==================

This section provides more detailed information about the board’s hardware.

Block Diagram
-------------

The block diagram below shows the components of ESP-Module-Prog-1(R) and their interconnections.

Power Source Select
-------------------

There are three mutually exclusive ways to provide power to the board:

- USB Type-C to UART port (default and recommended)
- 5V and GND header pins
- 3V3 and GND header pins

Strapping Pin Configuration
---------------------------

J4 on ESP-Module-Prog-1(R) is a 2-Pin header, with one end being P7 and one end being High (i.e. pull-up):

- For some modules, the corresponding pin of P7 is not a strapping pin and no pull-up is needed for downloading. In this case, a jump cap is not required for J4.
- For some modules, the corresponding pin of P7 is a strapping pin and a pull-up is needed for downloading. In this case, a jump cap is required for J4.

.. note::

  For the corresponding pin of P7 on Espressif modules, please refer to `ESP-Module-Prog-1(R) GPIO Map <https://dl.espressif.com/dl/schematics/GPIO_MAP_ESP-Module-Prog-1_V1.1_EN_20230523.xls>`__.

Measuring Current
-----------------

J5 on ESP-Module-Prog-1(R) can be used to measure the current of the module.

- Remove the J5 jumper cap: At this time, the peripherals and modules on the board are disconnected from the power supply, and the module current can be measured after the J5 pin is connected to the ammeter.
- Install the J5 jump cap (factory default): the board functions normally.

.. note::

  When using the 3V3 and GND header pins to power up the board, you need to remove the J5 jumper cap and connect an ammeter in series with the external circuit to measure the current of the module.


Pin Descriptions
----------------

The two tables below provide the **Name** and **Signal** of female headers on both sides of the board (J2 and J3). The pin names are shown in Figure :ref:`user-guide-esp-module-prog-1-front`. The numbering is the same as in the `ESP-Module-Prog-1(R) Schematics <https://dl.espressif.com/dl/schematics/esp_idf/esp-module-prog-1-schematics.pdf>`_ (PDF). For the corresponding pin of each signal on Espressif modules, please refer to `ESP-Module-Prog-1(R) GPIO Map <https://dl.espressif.com/dl/schematics/GPIO_MAP_ESP-Module-Prog-1_V1.1_EN_20230523.xls>`__.
