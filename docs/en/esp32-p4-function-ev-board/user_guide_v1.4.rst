New version available: :doc:`user_guide`

This user guide will help you get started with ESP32-P4-Function-EV-Board and will also provide more in-depth information.

ESP32-P4-Function-EV-Board is a multimedia development board based on the ESP32-P4 chip. ESP32-P4 chip features a dual-core 400 MHz RISC-V processor and supports up to 32 MB PSRAM. In addition, ESP32-P4 supports USB 2.0 specification, MIPI-CSI/DSI, H264 Encoder, and various other peripherals. With all of its outstanding features, the board is an ideal choice for developing low-cost, high-performance, low-power network-connected audio and video products.

The 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi 6 & Bluetooth 5 (LE) module ESP32-C6-MINI-1 serves as the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth module of the board. The board also includes a 7-inch capacitive touch screen with a resolution of 1024 x 600 and a 2MP camera with MIPI CSI, enriching the user interaction experience. The development board is suitable for prototyping a wide range of products, including visual doorbells, network cameras, smart home central control screens, LCD electronic price tags, two-wheel vehicle dashboards, etc.

Most of the I/O pins are broken out to the pin headers for easy interfacing. Developers can connect peripherals with jumper wires.

Start Application Development
------------------------------------

Before powering up your ESP32-P4-Function-EV-Board, please make sure that it is in good condition with no obvious signs of damage.

Required Hardware
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- ESP32-P4-Function-EV-Board
- USB cables
- Computer running Windows, Linux, or macOS

.. note::

  Be sure to use a good quality USB cable. Some cables are for charging only and do not provide the needed data lines nor work for programming the boards.

Optional Hardware
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- MicroSD card

Hardware Setup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Connect the ESP32-P4-Function-EV-Board to your computer using a USB cable. The board can be powered through any of the USB Type-C ports. The USB-to-UART Port is recommended for flashing firmware and debugging.

To connect the LCD, follow these steps:

1. Secure the development board to the LCD adapter board by attaching the short copper standoffs (8 mm in length) to the four standoff posts at the center of the LCD adapter board.
2. Connect the J3 header of the LCD adapter board to the MIPI DSI connector on the ESP32-P4-Function-EV-Board using the LCD ribbon cable (**reverse direction**). Note that the LCD adapter board is already connected to the LCD.
3. Use a DuPont wire to connect the RST_LCD pin of the J6 header of the LCD adapter board to the GPIO27 pin of the J1 header on the ESP32-P4-Function-EV-Board. The RST_LCD pin can be configured via software, with GPIO27 set as the default.
4. Use a DuPont wire to connect the PWM pin of the J6 header of the LCD adapter board to the GPIO26 pin of the J1 header on the ESP32-P4-Function-EV-Board. The PWM pin can be configured via software, with GPIO26 set as the default.
5. It is recommended to power the LCD by connecting a USB cable to the J1 header of the LCD adapter board. If this is not feasible, connect the 5V and GND pins of the LCD adapter board to corresponding pins on the J1 header of the ESP32-P4-Function-EV-Board, provided that the development board has sufficient power supply.
6. Attach the long copper standoffs (20 mm in length) to the four standoff posts on the periphery of the LCD adapter board to allow the LCD to stand upright.

In summary, the LCD adapter board and ESP32-P4-Function-EV-Board are connected via the following pins:

.. list-table::
  :widths: 20 20
  :header-rows: 1

  * - LCD Adapter Board
    - ESP32-P4-Function-EV
  * - J3 header
    - MIPI DSI connector
  * - RST_LCD pin of J6 header
    - GPIO27 pin of J1 header
  * - PWM pin of J6 header
    - GPIO26 pin of J1 header
  * - 5V pin of J6 header
    - 5V pin of J1 header
  * - GND pin of J6 header
    - GND pin of J1 header

.. note::

  - If you power the LCD adapter board by connecting a USB cable to its J1 header, you do not need to connect its 5V and GND pins to the corresponding pins on the development board.
  - To use the camera, connect the camera adapter board to the MIPI CSI connector on the development board using the camera ribbon cable (**forward direction**).
