==================

:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`

The ESP32-S3-DevKitM-1 is an entry-level development board equipped with either ESP32-S3-MINI-1 or ESP32-S3-MINI-1U, a module named for its small size. This board integrates complete Wi-Fi and Bluetooth® Low Energy functions.

Most of the I/O pins on the module are broken out to the pin headers on both sides of this board for easy interfacing. Developers can either connect peripherals with jumper wires or mount ESP32-S3-DevKitM-1 on a breadboard.
