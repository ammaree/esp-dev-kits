Board Overview
==============

ESP32-S3-USB-Bridge is a development board based on ESP32-S3.

- The `usb_wireless_bridge <https://github.com/espressif/esp-dev-kits/tree/master/examples/esp32-s3-usb-bridge/examples/usb_wireless_bridge>`_ example can be used to establish a bridge between a computer and the target chip. It can emulate a USB composite device and supports multiple functions:

  - **USB-to-UART Bridge**: realizes serial data transmission and reception between the computer and the target chip.
  - **JTAG Adapter**: realizes duplex JTAG communication between the computer and the target chip.
  - **MSC Storage Device**: updates firmware by storing the UF2 firmware files in the USB storage device of the board.
  - **Wireless Bridge**: realizes wireless flashing and wireless serial data transmission and reception through ESP-NOW.

   * - Key Component
     - Description
   * - ESP32-S3-MINI-1-N4R2 Module
     - ESP32-S3-MINI-1-N4R2 is a generic Wi-Fi + Bluetooth LE MCU module that is built around the ESP32-S3 series of SoCs. It is integrated with 4 MB flash and 2 MB PSRAM. On top of a rich set of peripherals, the acceleration for neural network computing and signal processing workloads provided by the SoC makes the module an ideal choice for a wide variety of application scenarios related to Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT).
   * - TX/RX Indicator
     - Indicates transmit and receive status of serial data.
   * - Expansion Connector
     - Provides connections for JTAG pins, serial pins, TX/RX pins, Boot pins, Reset pins, and power supply pins.
   * - Reset Button
     - Connects the Reset button on the target chip and IO8 on the module. Press this button to reset the target chip.
   * - USB-to-USB Port
     - Provides power to the entire system. Used for USB communication between the PC and the ESP32-S3-MINI-1 module.
   * - Boot Button
     - Connects the Boot button on the target chip and IO9 on the module. Holding down the Boot button and momentarily pressing the Reset button initiates the firmware upload mode. Then you can upload firmware through the serial port or USB.

Software Support
----------------

Development of applications for ESP32-S3-USB-Bridge can be done using `ESP-IDF <https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf>`_ framework. ESP-IDF is a FreeRTOS-based SoC development framework with several components including LCD, ADC, RMT, and SPI. An example is provided for ESP32-S3-LCD-EV-Board under the folder :project:`Examples <examples/esp32-s3-usb-bridge/examples>`. You can configure project options by entering ``idf.py menuconfig`` in the example directory.

.. note::

  - The current supported ESP-IDF version is release/5.0.
  - To prevent the default firmware from being replaced, please avoid pressing and holding the module's own Boot button while powering the board up/down.

- 1 x LCD subboard
- 1 x USB 2.0 cable (standard Type-A to Type-C)
- 1 x PC (Windows, Linux, or macOS)

.. note::

  Please make sure to use the appropriate USB cable. Some cables can only be used for charging, not for data transfer or program flashing.


Hardware Setup
--------------

Prepare the board for loading of the first sample application:

1. Plug in the USB cable to connect the PC with the USB port on the board.
2. Make sure the board is in the download mode.
3. The LED lights up indicating the completion of flashing.

Now the board is ready for software setup.
