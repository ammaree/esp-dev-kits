This user guide will help you get started with ESP-Prog and will also provide more in-depth information.

ESP-Prog is one of Espressif’s development and debugging tools, with functions including automatic firmware downloading, serial communication, and JTAG debugging. ESP-Prog's automatic firmware downloading and serial communication functions are supported on ESP8266, ESP32, ESP32-S2, ESP32-S3, and ESP32-C3, while the JTAG debugging is supported only on ESP32, ESP32-S2, ESP32-S3, and ESP32-C3.

ESP-Prog can be easily connected to a PC with the use of only one USB cable. Then, the PC can identify the board's Program and JTAG interfaces (functions) by their port numbers.

Given that the power supply voltage may vary on different user boards, either of the ESP-Prog interfaces can provide 5 V or 3.3 V power supply through pin headers, in order to ensure power compatibility. Power on ESP-Prog could be toggled between 3.3 V and 5 V, but the RX/TX & JTAG signals will always be at the 3.3 V level.

Start Application Development
-----------------------------

Before powering up your board, please make sure that it is in good condition with no obvious signs of damage.


Required Hardware
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- ESP-Prog
- USB 2.0 cable (Standard-A to Micro-B)
- Computer running Windows, Linux, or macOS
- Dupont lines or flat cables provided by Espressif for connecting the development board to ESP-Prog

.. note::

  Be sure to use an appropriate USB cable. Some cables are for charging only and do not provide the needed data lines nor work for programming the boards.


Hardware Setup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Connect the ESP-Prog board and the PC USB port via a USB cable.
2. The PC then detects the two ports of ESP-Prog, indicating that the board is connected successfully. If the ports are not detected install the `FT2232HL chip driver <http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/VCP.htm>`__ on your PC.
3. Select the output power voltage for the Program/JTAG interfaces, using PROG PWR SEL/JTAG PWR SEL pin headers.
4. Connect the ESP-Prog and ESP user board with the flat cables provided by Espressif.
5. Start programming (downloading) or JTAG debugging, using the official software tools or scripts provided by Espressif.


Software Setup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Please proceed to `Get Started with ESP-IDF <https://idf.espressif.com/>`__, where Section `Installation Step by Step <https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32/get-started/index.html#installation-step-by-step>`__ will quickly help you set up the development environment.


Contents and Packaging
----------------------

Retail Orders
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Each ESP-Prog board comes in an individual package.

   ESP-Prog Package Contents

The contents are as follows:

- Development board

  ESP-Prog

- Cables

  Two flexible flat cables:
    - One cable for JTAG 1.27 mm interface to connect to 2*5-PIN male shrouded box header.
